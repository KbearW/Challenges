# Write a program that counts from 1 to 20 in fizzbuzz fashion.

# To do so, loop from 1 to 20 (inclusive). Each time through, if the number is evenly divisible by 3, say ‘fizz’. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, say ‘buzz’. If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, say ‘fizzbuzz’. Otherwise, say the number.

# For example:

# >>> fizzbuzz()
# 1
# 2
# fizz
# 4
# buzz
# fizz
# 7
# 8
# fizz
# buzz
# 11
# fizz
# 13
# 14
# fizzbuzz
# 16
# 17
# fizz
# 19
# buzz

# We given you a file, fizzbuzz.py, with a method, fizzbuzz:

# def fizzbuzz():
#     """Count from 1 to 20 in fizzbuzz fashion."""

# However, this method is unimplemented.
