# By default, when you print text to the terminal, the text automatically takes up the entire width of the terminal. If the line is too long, terminals will wrap the text and continue it on another line. However, most terminals don’t wrap text intelligently — sometimes they’ll break words like this:

# Hello, this is a really long line. The char
# cter limit is 43 though, so the word 'chara
# cter' is butchered.

# It would be nice if instead, text was wrapped without breaking words:

# Hello, this is a really long line. The
# character limit is 43 though, so the word
# 'character' is butchered.

# Write a function that takes in a string and a character limit (as an integer). It should print the contents of the string without going over the character limit and without breaking words. For example:

# >>> fit_to_width('Hello, world! I love Python and Hackbright',
# ...              10)
# Hello,
# world! I
# love
# Python and
# Hackbright

# Your test input will never contain a character limit that is smaller than the largest continuous sequence of non-whitespace characters (however, this is a great edge case to handle as an additional challenge!)

# We’ve provided fit-to-width.py which contains test cases and a function stub for you to complete.
