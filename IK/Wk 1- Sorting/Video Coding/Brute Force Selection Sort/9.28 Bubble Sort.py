'''based on sudo code given, code the select sort algo out'''

# Bubble sort: iterate over the array, then starts from R to L to find the smallest # and keep moving it alone
# "Bubble up" in a way

# This method is very similar to Selection sort in that selection sort scan from L -> R and direct swap
# while bubble sort starts from R -> L and keep swapping the smallest item towards the L.

# sudo code:
    # for i in 0 to (n-1):
    #     for red in (n-1) down to (i+1):
    #         if A[red-1] > A[red]:
    #             swap A[red-1], A[red]
    # return A
